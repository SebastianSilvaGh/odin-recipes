Odin recipes

In this first project, i'll write some of the recipes that i've cooked in my life.

Is not a large list, but, i consider that this recipes are the most important, and above all are the one's that i can remember clearly how to do it!

In this repository also i'll show to me if i can write html code without die on the try! I'll try to write and structure some good stuff! 

Let's check it out  if i was able to do that!
